- Lambda is a serverless compute platform. EC2 would be an example of a server-specific platform.
- The two primary ways you are charged for using Lambda are the number of time your code is executed (execution request), and how long it takes for your code to execute (execution duration).
- You are only charged (by the millisecond) for how long it takes you code to run each time it is executed.
- Lambda will eventually replace EC2 AWS service
- Node.js, Java, C#, Python - run time environment in AWS lambda Service
